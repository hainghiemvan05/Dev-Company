- With Orders Segment:
  - E-commerce company has done a great job in delievery to customer with 93% order deliveried on time
  - The majority of late delivery was on holiday occasions as (National day, Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil, Carnival)
  - Beside that, The disadvantages of geographical location of Roraima (RR), Amapá (AP), Acre (AC) is the reason that time of delievery to these location is the longest one.

# 6. Conclusion & Recommendation
- According to the analysis, I have observed significant numbers as follow:
  - Family and sporty items are the most purchased items. There are also other trending products followed by different months.
  - The company has excelled in delivery service, but it's challenging to deliver to some remote states due to geographical limitations.
  - Credit cards are the most popular financial service.
  - The company's services have received excellent reviews from customers, with the majority being 5-star ratings.

- 🚩 Therefore, I believe that this E-commerce should:
  - Run creative seasonal marketing campaigns with different items.
  - Implement recommendation marketing services to promote the business.
  - For remote areas, to enhance services and quality, specific campaigns should be created, such as offering more vouchers and discounts to improve their experience.
  - Continue collaborating with local businesses, such as banks and financial services, to enhance customer service experiences.
- Regarding the trending purchases by Brazilians, overall, we can see that E-commerce has experienced sustainable growth in total orders over time. Especially in November 2017, there was a significant surge in orders, possibly due to the Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil. I believe that the E-commerce company took advantage of this event to promote its business.
